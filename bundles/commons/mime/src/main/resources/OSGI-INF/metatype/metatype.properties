mime.service.name = Apache Sling MIME Type Service
mime.service.description = The Sling MIME Type Service provides support for \
 maintaining and configuring MIME Type mappings.
mime.types.name = MIME Types
mime.types.description = Configures additional MIME type mappings in the \
 traditional mime.types file format: Each property is a blank space separated \
 list of strings where the first string is the MIME type and the rest of the \
 strings are filename extensions referring to the MIME type. Using this \
 property additional MIME type mappings may be defined. Existing MIME type \
 mappings cannot be redefined and setting such mappings in this property \
 has no effect. For a list of existing mappings refer to the MIME Types page.
